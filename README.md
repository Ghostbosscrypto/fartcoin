fart token only on BSC - holding your fart could be a good idea

About FART
Introducing the Shit Coin you all wanted but never asked for FART! The Fart token is Meme Token and should be treated as such.

There is a total of 10,000,000 tokens. Phase one will be airdropped to those who apply before the airdrop period ends.

You can not trade more than 100,000 Fart as releasing too much FART at once will cause a dump, no one wants to SHART.

Every trade there is a 8% fee this is known as the FART Tax. Think of when you Fart everyone in the whole room gets a whiff and you burn a little on release.

4% is shared between token holders the fart sniffers
4% is burned when you push a fart trade.
 

So holding your farts in might actually be the best solution especially if you are in a confined space.
